# 3D Mental Rotation Test (3D-MRT)

A Unity-based adaptation of the standard paper-based Mental Rotation Test, providing an interactive high-fidelity 3D assessment of spatial reasoning abilities.

## Overview

This test presents participants with 12 progressively complex 3D shapes constructed from cubic blocks. For each task, participants view a reference shape and must identify two correct rotated versions from four options. The system automatically tracks completion times and provides visual feedback for correct/incorrect selections.

## Key Features

- **Progressive Complexity**: Shape complexity increases across 12 tasks
- **Dual Correct Answers**: Two of four options are correct for each task
- **Automatic Timing**: System records total time and calculates average time per shape
- **Visual Feedback**: Green highlights for correct selections, red for incorrect
- **Two-Run Protocol**: Participants complete the test twice for reliability

## Scoring Method

The current version requires manual score calculation. Follow these steps:

1. **Record Completion Data**:
   - Total time for both runs (seconds)
   - Number of errors per run
   - Calculate average time per shape: `total_time / 12`

2. **Apply Time Penalties**:
   - For each error, add one average shape time to total time
   - Example: 44s total, 3.6s average per shape, 2 errors = 44 + (2 Ã— 3.6) = 51.2s

3. **Calculate Final Score**:
   - Average the adjusted total times from both runs
   - Lower scores indicate better spatial reasoning performance

## Usage

Participants are informed that completion time is the primary scoring factor, but specific times and penalties are not displayed during testing to avoid performance anxiety.

**Note**: Automatic scoring will be implemented in a future version.
